# Digital Collection Proposal

## Object
Knitting Patterns for Electronic Knitting Machines

## Proposal
Although industrialization has generally moved production away from the home and to the factory, home production still represents a well-spring of design ideas and expression. Overtime, factory production techniques have devolved from industry back to the home. 3D printing is the latest of these innovations, but it has been preceded by a number of previous tools. In order to preserve the rich heritage of innovative in-home production techniques, I have identified a collection of programming instructions used for Brother knitting machines in the 1990s and 2000s.

## Scope
The collection consists of 30 .dat files (roughly 30 megabytes) containing code that used to run a Brother KH-930E. When possible, a photograph(s) of a finished piece of knitwear will also be collected.

## Acquisition
Instruction files will be downloaded from an active knitting forum that still uses Brother knitting machines. During collection, any accompanying images of knitwear will also be collected. Because the instruction files and images are the intellectual property of their creators, permission will be obtained from creator to include them in the collection.  Objects will be placed in a bag while we wait for description.

## Preservation challenges
Because of the niche nature of the machines that used these files, the file formats are probably not registered in any major format database. Part of this collection project may require creating a format profile of these objects. Also, these files are relatively inscrutable without a working machine and knitting materials. For this reason, documentation of finished knitting projects should be collected alongwith the data files.
