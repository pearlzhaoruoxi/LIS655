## Institution
Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum

## Proposal
Although industrialization has generally moved production away from the home and to the factory, home production still represents a well-spring of design ideas and expression. Overtime, factory production techniques have devolved from industry back to the home. 3D printing is the latest of these innovations, but it has been preceded by a number of previous tools. In order to preserve the rich heritage of innovative in-home production techniques, I have identified a collection of programming instructions used for Brother knitting machines in the 1980s and 1990s.

## Scope
The collection consists of 30 .dat files (30 megabytes) containing code that used to run a Brother KH-930E. In addition, I propose that we also obtain or produce representations of the knitwear produced by these instructions.

## Acquisition
Instruction files will be downloaded from an active knitting forum that still uses Brother knitting machines. During collection, any accompanying images of knitwear will also be collected. Because the instruction files and images are the intellectual property of their creators, permission will be obtained from creator to include them in the collection.

## Preservation challenges
Because of the niche nature of the machines that used these files, they file formats are not current registered in any major file format database. Part of this collection project will require creating a format profile of these objects. Also, these files are relatively inscrutable without a working machine and knitting materials. For this reason, documentation of finished knitting projects will be collected alongwith the data files.
